## Updates {#updates}

-   Trying to improve [Experimental Approach: Using Phosphorothioate Nucleotides to Make Carbon Nanotube, DNA, Quantum Dot Hybrids]({{< relref "experimental_approach_using_phosphorothioate_nucleotides_to_make_carbon_nanotube_dna_quantum_dot_hybrids.md" >}})
    -   Tried adjusting pH of QDs down (with HCl) to protonate MPA capping ligand to reduce electrostatic repulsion of QDs and CNTs
        -   Quenching of flouresence, not able to be recovered even after bringing pH up (with NaOH)
    -   Would adjusting pH of phosphorothioate NTs up protonate the O- or will cleavage of nitrogenous base occur?
-   Free Cd+ in solution/adsorbed to QD surface might be interfering with adsorbtion to CNTs solubalized with phosphorothioate DNA
    -   We see some evidence of this comparing [Sample: 2023-05-22 CNT:AC6-GT6 Retentate + QD Raw]({{< relref "sample_2023_05_22_cnt_ac6_gt6_retentate_qd_raw.md" >}}) to [Sample: 2023-05-22 CNT:AC3-GT3 Retentate + QD Retentate]({{< relref "sample_2023_05_22_cnt_ac3_gt3_retentate_qd_retentate.md" >}}), the filtered QD perform much better
    -   Tried to do methanol purification of QDs to remove Cd+ and MPA<sup><a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">1</a></sup>
        -   TEM has been broken, unable to look at them
        -   Look at via AFM but didnt find anything (strangely enough not even individual CNTs)
-   QD concentrations seem very low
    -   Quantified via nanodrop
    -   Very few visible precipitates via acid tritration, methanol purification, and non-selective precipitation with acetone<sup><a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">2</a></sup>
    -   Methods I want to try to increase concentration
        -   Ultracentrifugation with low molecular weight filter
            -   These are currently on back order, I am tring to find alternative suppliers, do you have suggestion on good companies?
        -   Gel
            -   non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
                -   8% polyacrylamide in the absence of SDS or other denaturing agent and run at 150 V for 60 min.
            -   There are some other QD based gel purification papers I found but still need to read
        -   Rotary evaporation
            -   Do you know where I can access to one?
-   LiCl arrived yesterday
-   Will send sequences for ordering to make divalent QDs (to check we get QD:DNA)
-   Would also like to get a longer phosphorothioated GT sequence
    -   Higher total binding affinity for CNTs, should prevent any issues of QDs 'ripping' off strands when complexing


## Questions {#questions}

-   QD preparation seems to used degassed water. I still get QDs with normal diH2O but could this be a problem? It seems that degassed water is used normal H2O leads to oxidation of Te
-   I tried to scale up QD synthesis by 10x increasing all precursors but I did not get good growth (look very long to see luminescence, stopped at yellow not red), why could this be?
