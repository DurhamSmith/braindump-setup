In physics, the Beer–Lambert law (also known as the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law or Beer's law), is an empirical law which relates the attenuation of light to the properties of the material through which the light is travelling. The law is commonly applied to chemical analysis measurements and used in understanding attenuation in physical optics, for photons, neutrons, or rarefied gases. In mathematical physics, this law arises as a solution of the BGK equation.

\\[\log(I\_{0}/I)=A=\varepsilon \ell c}\\]
Where

-   A is the absorbance
-   &epsilon; is the extinction coefficient (also known as: molar attenuation coefficient or absorptivity of the attenuating species)
-   &ell; is the optical path length
-   C is the concentration of the attenuating species
