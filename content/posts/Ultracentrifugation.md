1.  Insert the ultrafiltration filter into the filtration tube.
    -   Only touch the side wall of the filter not to give damage to the filter.
    -   50 kDa and 100 kDa filters are proper for the purification of DNA origami.
2.  Pour 500 ul of 5 mM MgCl2 into the filter (for wetting the filter before filtration).
    -   Grab only side wall of the filter to reduce contamination of the filter.
3.  Centrifuge the tube at 5,000 rcf and room temperature for 8 min
4.  Discard the filtrated buffer, and sequentially pour 100 ul of sample and 400 ul of 5 mM MgCl2.
    -   Total volume should be 500 ul = x ul of sample + (500 â€“ x) ul of the buffer.
5.  Centrifuge the tube at 5,000 rcf and room temperature for 8 min.
6.  Discard the filtrated buffer and pour 450 ul of 5 mM MgCl2 into the filter.
7.  Repeat steps 5 and 6 two times.
8.  Discard the previous filtration tube and insert the new filtration tube into the filter while inverting the tube (not filter).
9.  Centrifuge the tube at 8,000 rcf and room temperature for 8 min.
