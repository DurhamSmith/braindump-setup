I have experimentally observed that the luminescence of CdTe quantum dots is blueshifted in the presence of buffers with NaCl. This can be seen in the figure [1](#figure--fig:CdTe-in-Different-Buffers) where the first tube indicates the CdTe QDs original color. Varying the concentrations of NaCl seems to have some effect on both the shift and overall luminescence but not as start as the jump from 0&rarr; 100mM NaCl as shown in figure [2](#figure--fig:CdTe-NaCl).
