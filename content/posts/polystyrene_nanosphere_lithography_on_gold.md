## Gold and PS Polystyrene Nanospheres have incompatible charges in water {#gold-and-ps-polystyrene-nanospheres-have-incompatible-charges-in-water}

[The Gold-Water Interface Has a Negative Charge]({{< relref "the_gold_water_interface_has_a_negative_charge.md" >}}) and [Polystyrene Nanospheres Typically Have A Negative Charge]({{< relref "polystyrene_nanospheres_typically_have_a_negative_charge.md" >}}).
Solutions to get around this:

-   Electrochemical polarization
    -   Apply a DC voltage to gold
    -   What oxidation/reduction reaction will occur?
-   Use a different solvent
    -   Gold is not really charged in ethanol, ethanol is also needed for SAM growth
-   Use a very low PH makes golds surface positively charged
    -   Prolonged exposure to highly acidic conditions or concentrated acids may still lead to some degree of swelling or changes in the size or morphology of the PS nanospheres.
-   Surface activation using plasma
    -   a possible step to improve adhesion is to perform a mild surface activation of the gold surface. This can be done by exposing the cleaned gold surface to a low-energy plasma treatment or UV/ozone treatment. These treatments can introduce reactive functional groups on the gold surface, which can enhance the physical interactions with the PS nanospheres.
