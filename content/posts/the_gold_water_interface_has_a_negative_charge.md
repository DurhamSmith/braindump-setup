The gold-water interface typically exhibits a negative surface charge under standard conditions. This negative charge arises due to the adsorption of hydroxyl ions (OH-) from water onto the gold surface. The presence of these hydroxyl ions creates a negatively charged layer known as the electrical double layer.

In aqueous solutions, gold surfaces tend to adsorb a layer of water molecules, and some of these water molecules dissociate into hydroxyl ions (OH-) and hydronium ions (H3O+). The OH- ions are attracted to the gold surface due to electrostatic interactions, resulting in a negatively charged surface.

It's important to note that the charge on the gold-water interface can be influenced by various factors such as pH, presence of other ions, and surface treatments. For example, at very low pH values (acidic conditions), the gold surface may become positively charged due to the formation of positively charged hydronium ions. However, under normal physiological conditions (neutral to slightly alkaline pH), the gold-water interface is predominantly negatively charged
