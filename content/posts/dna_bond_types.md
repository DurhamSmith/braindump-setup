## Classic Bond {#classic-bond}

These are bonds which are formed via Watson-Crick base paring of DNA and are used to denote positioning of entities attached to each DNA strands on opposite sides of the double helix that joins them.
In classical bonds the entities are attached to DNA on the same prime end (i.e either both at the 5' or both at the 3' end).


## Zip Bond {#zip-bond}

These are bonds which are formed via Watson-Crick base paring of DNA and are used to denote positioning of entities attached to each DNA strands on the same side of the double helix that joins them.
In classical bonds the entities are attached to DNA on the opposite prime end (i.e one entity is on the 5' end while the other is on the 3' end).
