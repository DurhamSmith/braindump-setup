#+title: Decision Tree Learning

/Decision Tree Learning/ is a method of learning which approximates
discrete-valued functions that is robust to noisy data, and is capable
of learning disjunctive expressions

It is most appropriate when:
1. instances are represented as attribute pairs
2. the target function has discrete output values
3. Disjunctive descriptions may be required
4. The training data may contain errors
5. The training data may contain missing attribute values
