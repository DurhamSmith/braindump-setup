#+title: Basic Indexing vs Advanced Indexing in Numpy

A key difference to take note of for indexing in [[id:5e19170b-e156-488a-89c3-d7c7764e033e][Numpy]] is that basic indexing
always produces a view, while advanced indexing produces a copy of the data.
Hence, advanced indexing can slow, and where basic indexing is sufficient it
should be used instead.

Basic indexing is triggered when the selection object is the standard ~x[obj]~
syntax, where ~obj~ is a tuple. When ~obj~ is not a tuple (e.g. an array), then
advanced selection is triggered.

- Basic indexing :: ~x[1:2]~
- Advanced indexing :: ~x[[1, 2]]~
